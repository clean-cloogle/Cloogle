The [Clean][] language search engine. Cloogle lets you search for functions,
types, classes and modules from Clean libraries. It also has documentation for
language features, common compiler errors and ABC instructions. The web app is
available at [cloogle.org][].

Cloogle was inspired by [Hoogle][]. As of June 27, 2018, Cloogle indexes
100&times; less lines of code than Hoogle (25 thousand vs. 2.3 million). This
allows Cloogle to implement more advanced features, such as `using` queries to
find usages.
